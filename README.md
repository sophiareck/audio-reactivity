# Dev
If you'd like to run/test/edit this code locally yourself, run the following in your terminal
```
# install npm
npm install -g http-server
http-server # from the root directory (wherever index.html is)
```

If you'd like to see debug logs, change `p5.min.js` in line 34 of index.html to `p5.js`
